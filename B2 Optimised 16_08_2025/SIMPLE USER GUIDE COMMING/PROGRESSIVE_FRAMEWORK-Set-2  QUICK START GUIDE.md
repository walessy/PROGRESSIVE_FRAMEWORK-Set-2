## ðŸ’¡ Smart Project Management Tips

### Keep Projects Focused
- One project = one main goal/application
- Don't mix unrelated projects in the same Claude project

### Save Your Progress
- When Claude creates useful artifacts (code, documents, designs), save them to the project
- Download important files to your local PC
- Organize everything in folders by functionality

### Version Control Made Easy
- **Version 1**: Work in your current project until it's "done enough"
- **Version 2**: Start fresh! Create a new Claude project and repeat the process
- Keep your learnings and improvements from V1 to make V2 even better

## ðŸ”„ The Evolution Cycle

```
Project Idea â†’ Claude Project â†’ Upload Framework â†’ Build & Create â†’ 
Save Artifacts â†’ Download & Organize â†’ Start Version 2 â†’ Repeat
```

## Why This Works So Well

1. **No Complex Setup**: No installation, no dependencies, no technical configuration
2. **AI-Native**: The framework is designed to work with Claude's intelligence
3. **Iterative Development**: Build, learn, improve, repeat
4. **Universal Application**: Works for any type of project
