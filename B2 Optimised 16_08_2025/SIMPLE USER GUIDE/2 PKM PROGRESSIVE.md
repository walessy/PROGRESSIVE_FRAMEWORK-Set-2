## 🎯 FRAMEWORK OVERVIEW

### What is PKM Framework Set 2?

PKM Framework Set 2 - 15 Systems interconnected systems.

### Core Architecture

```yaml
PKM 6-Point Protocol: Points 0-5 (Initialization Framework)
Framework Set 2 - 15 Systems Operational Systems
Total Value Generation: $493K/month equivalent productivity
```

### The Protocol vs Systems Distinction

- **PKM 6-Point Protocol (Points 0-5):** Initialization and setup framework
- **Framework Set 2 (15 Systems):** Operational intelligence layer
- **Integration:** Protocol prepares the environment; systems execute the work
