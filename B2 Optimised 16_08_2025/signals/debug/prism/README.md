# PRISM Debug Engine Signals

**ENGINE**: PRISM - Prevention & Risk Management - Proactive debugging and risk assessment
**PURPOSE**: Debug signal processing for PRISM debugging engine
**FRAMEWORK**: Progressive Framework Set 2 - Debugging Engines Integration
**CREATED**: 2025-08-19 10:57:10

## Debug Signal Types

This directory processes debug signals specifically for the PRISM debugging engine.

### PRISM Capabilities

Prevention & Risk Management - Proactive debugging and risk assessment

## Signal Processing

- **Debug Events**: System errors, performance issues, coordination problems
- **Resolution Tracking**: Automated correction attempts and success rates  
- **Learning Integration**: Pattern recognition for future debugging improvement
- **Cross-Engine Coordination**: Integration with other debugging engines

## File Naming Convention

- `prism_debug_YYYYMMDD_HHMMSS.signal`
- Contains debug metadata and resolution instructions
- Processed by PRISM engine for intelligent debugging
