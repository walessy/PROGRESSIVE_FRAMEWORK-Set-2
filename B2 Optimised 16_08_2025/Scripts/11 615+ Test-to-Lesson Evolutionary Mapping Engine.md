## üéØ **REVOLUTIONARY CONCEPT: EDUCATIONAL ARCHAEOLOGY**

### **The Evolutionary Mapping Philosophy**
> **"Every lesson is a learning artifact that remains valuable across framework evolution. As tests evolve, lessons map and remap, creating a living library of educational intelligence that grows smarter with every change."**

### **Never Delete, Always Evolve**
The evolutionary mapping engine transforms the breathing framework into an intelligent educational archaeology that:
- **Preserves all valuable educational content** across framework evolution
- **Automatically adapts lessons** across all 15 systems
- **Protects student progress** during curriculum changes
- **Creates intelligent discovery** through enhanced recommendation algorithms

## üèóÔ∏è **CORE ARCHITECTURE**

### **üìä Complete Framework Coverage**
- **Total Systems**: 15 (Framework Set 2: 1-13 + DPI: 14 + PTODOS: 15)
- **Total Test Cases**: 615+ (560 Framework Set 2 + 25 DPI + 30 PTODOS + 53 Cross-System)
- **Total Lesson Modules**: 615+ (1:1 test-to-lesson mapping with evolutionary variants)
- **Chat Commands**: 15 (one per system for focused implementation)
