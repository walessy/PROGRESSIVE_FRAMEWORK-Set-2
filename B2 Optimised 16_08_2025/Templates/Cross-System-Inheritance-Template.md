# ðŸ”— **CROSS-SYSTEM INHERITANCE TEMPLATE**
**Template for Cross-System Lesson Adaptation and Inheritance**

## ðŸŽ¯ **INHERITANCE MAPPING**

```yaml
Source Lesson Information:
  source_system: "Original system (1-15)"
  source_lesson_id: "Original lesson identifier"
  source_version: "Original lesson version"
  adaptation_date: "Date of cross-system adaptation"

Target System Information:
  target_systems: ["List of target systems for adaptation"]
  adaptation_type: "direct|modified|specialized|foundational"
  relevance_score: "Relevance percentage (0-100%)"
  adaptation_effort: "low|medium|high|custom"

Inheritance Chain:
  parent_lessons: ["Lessons this inherits from"]
  child_adaptations: ["Lessons that inherit from this"]
  sibling_lessons: ["Related lessons in same system"]
  cross_references: ["Related lessons in other systems"]
```

## ðŸ”„ **ADAPTATION STRATEGIES**

### **Direct Inheritance (90-100% relevance)**
- Minimal adaptation required
- Core concepts directly applicable
- Examples need system-specific context
- Assessments remain largely unchanged

### **Modified Inheritance (70-89% relevance)**
- Moderate adaptation required
- Core concepts applicable with modifications
- Examples need significant system context
- Assessments require system-specific scenarios

### **Specialized Inheritance (50-69% relevance)**
- Significant adaptation required
- Core concepts need specialization
- Examples completely system-specific
- Assessments designed for target system

### **Foundational Inheritance (30-49% relevance)**
- Lesson provides foundation only
- Target system needs extensive additions
- Examples are illustrative, not prescriptive
- Assessments focus on foundational understanding

## ðŸŽ“ **ADAPTATION GUIDELINES**

### **Content Adaptation Rules**
1. **Preserve Core Value**: Maintain educational essence
2. **System Context**: Adapt examples to target system
3. **Terminology Alignment**: Use target system terminology
4. **Assessment Relevance**: Ensure assessments test target system knowledge

### **Cross-Reference Management**
- Link to source lesson for complete context
- Reference related target system lessons
- Maintain inheritance chain documentation
- Update discovery algorithms with new mappings

### **Student Experience**
- Clear indication of lesson adaptation source
- Seamless navigation between related lessons
- Progressive difficulty appropriate to target system
- Achievement recognition across system boundaries

**Use this template when adapting lessons across system boundaries to maintain educational quality and cross-system coherence.**
