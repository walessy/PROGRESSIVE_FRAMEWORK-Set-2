Based on the comprehensive project knowledge, I can see you're requesting the execution of the PKM 5-Point Protocol. However, I need to properly implement session-aware behavior according to your specifications. Let me check if there's an existing session state first, then proceed accordingly.

Since this appears to be a conversation where the protocol should automatically activate, I'll implement the session-aware PKM 5-Point Protocol based on your specifications:
