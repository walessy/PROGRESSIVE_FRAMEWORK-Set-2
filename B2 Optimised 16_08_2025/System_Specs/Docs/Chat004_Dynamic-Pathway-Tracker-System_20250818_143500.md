## 🎯 **SYSTEM OVERVIEW**

**System Name**: Dynamic Pathway Intelligence (DPI)  
**Integration**: CONTEXT-EVOLUTION-ENGINE (System 7) + KNOWLEDGE-EVOLUTION-ENGINE (System 10)  
**Purpose**: Remember exploration paths, track depth, surface options dynamically  
**Innovation**: Solve AI conversation "pathway amnesia" problem  

---

## 🧠 **THE PROBLEM YOU'VE IDENTIFIED**

### **"Pathway Amnesia" in AI Conversations**
```yaml
Current Limitations:
  - AI forgets previous option branches when diving deep
  - Users lose track of unexplored pathways
  - No dynamic reminders of available options
  - Context switching without pathway preservation
  - Linear conversation flow vs. tree exploration needs

Your Insight:
  "I need to nest deeper and get reminders of options when I reach endpoints"
  "Like covering all pathways dynamically"
  "The Claude AI just doesn't do that"
```

### **Real-World Impact**
- **Lost Opportunities**: Missing valuable exploration branches
- **Cognitive Overload**: Trying to remember multiple option layers
- **Inefficient Exploration**: Repeating or missing pathways
- **Decision Fatigue**: Overwhelmed by options without structure
