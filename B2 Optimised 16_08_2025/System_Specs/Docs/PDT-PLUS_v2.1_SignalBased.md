## 🔄 **SIGNAL-BASED DEBUGGING ARCHITECTURE**

### **Signal Processing Core**
```yaml
Debugging Signal Integration:
  debug_signals: "signals/debug/{engine}_{event_type}_{timestamp}.signal"
  architecture_signals: "signals/systems/{system_id}_{timestamp}.signal"
  coordination_signals: "signals/coordination/{coordination_type}_{timestamp}.signal"
  
Signal Workflow:
  1. Debug event triggers signal generation
  2. Signal file created with debug context and metadata
  3. Debugging engines process signal in priority order
  4. Coordinated response executed across engines
  5. Signal archived with resolution audit trail

Performance Targets:
  signal_processing_time: "< 30 seconds"
  coordination_success_rate: "> 95%"
  debug_resolution_efficiency: "> 98%"
  prevention_success_rate: "> 85%"
```

### **Event-Driven Debugging Workflow**
```yaml
Trigger Events:
  code_error_detected: "Generate debug signal with error context"
  architecture_violation: "Create architectural debug signal"
  performance_degradation: "Signal performance debug analysis"
  integration_failure: "Generate cross-system debug coordination signal"
  
Signal Benefits:
  - No CPU overhead from continuous monitoring
  - Eliminates watchdog crashes and timeouts
  - Handles high-frequency debug events efficiently
  - Signal files provide complete debug audit trail
  - Clean separation between detection and processing
