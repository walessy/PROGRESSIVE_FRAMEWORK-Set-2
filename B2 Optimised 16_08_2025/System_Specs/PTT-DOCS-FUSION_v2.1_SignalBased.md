---

## üîÑ **SIGNAL-BASED ARCHITECTURE**

### **Signal Processing Core**
```yaml
Signal Integration:
  test_case_signals: "signals/test_cases/{test_id}_{timestamp}.signal"
  documentation_signals: "signals/docs/{doc_type}_{timestamp}.signal"
  fusion_signals: "signals/fusion/{test_doc_id}_{timestamp}.signal"
  
Signal Workflow:
  1. Test case save triggers signal generation
  2. Signal file created with test metadata
  3. Documentation engine processes signal
  4. Auto-generated documentation updates
  5. Signal archived with audit trail

Performance Targets:
  signal_processing_time: "< 30 seconds"
  coordination_success_rate: "> 95%"
  documentation_sync_accuracy: "> 98%"
```

### **Event-Driven Test Documentation**
```yaml
Trigger Events:
  test_case_saved: "Auto-generate documentation from test execution data"
  test_executed: "Update living documentation with execution results"
  test_failed: "Generate troubleshooting documentation automatically"
  test_coverage_changed: "Update coverage documentation in real-time"
  
Signal Benefits:
  - No CPU overhead from continuous monitoring
  - Eliminates watchdog crashes and timeouts
  - Handles high-frequency test saves efficiently
  - Signal files provide complete audit trail
  - Clean separation between events and processing
```
