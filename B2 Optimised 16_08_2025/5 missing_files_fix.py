## üéØ **REVOLUTIONARY CONCEPT: EDUCATIONAL ARCHAEOLOGY**

### **The Evolutionary Mapping Philosophy**
> **"Every lesson is a learning artifact that remains valuable across framework evolution. As tests evolve, lessons map and remap, creating a living library of educational intelligence that grows smarter with every change."**

### **Never Delete, Always Evolve**
The evolutionary mapping engine transforms the breathing framework into an intelligent educational archaeology that:
- **Preserves all valuable educational content** across framework evolution
- **Automatically adapts lessons** across all 15 systems
- **Protects student progress** during curriculum changes
- **Creates intelligent discovery** through enhanced recommendation algorithms

## üèóÔ∏è **CORE ARCHITECTURE**
