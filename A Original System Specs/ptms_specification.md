**Primary Mission:** Provide intelligent workflow orchestration that automatically detects development context, business conditions, and system states to trigger optimal coordination patterns across all 22 Progressive Systems.

**Key Objectives:**
- Automate workflow triggering based on intelligent context detection
- Optimize system activation sequences for maximum efficiency
- Reduce cognitive overhead through intelligent automation
- Enable adaptive coordination patterns that evolve with experience
